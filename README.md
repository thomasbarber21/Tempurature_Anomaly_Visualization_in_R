# Tempurature Anomaly Visualization in R
The following R script file produces an mp4 of temperature anomalies in the US from 1901-2012. It first displays a map of the US and yearly data for temperture anomaly 
by state. This yearly average is then recorded and a line graph for the US average temperature anomaly per year is then tracked to see the overall increase.

Unfortunately the data is too large to upload to Github for reproducibility, but the script files and final output are. To view the mp4 file from Github simply click on the file and download the Raw.
