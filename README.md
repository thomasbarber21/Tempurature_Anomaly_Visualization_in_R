# Tempurature Anomaly Visualization in R
The following R script file produces an mp4 of temperature anomalies in the US from 1901-2012. It first displays a map of the US and yearly data for temperture anomaly 
by state. This yearly average is then recorded and a line graph for the US average temperature anomaly per year is then tracked to see the overall increase.

To reproduce the mp4 simply download 1_data_processing.R and 2_data_visualization.R. Run 1_data_processing.R first and 2_data_visualization.R second. The output 
will be printed into your current working directory.
